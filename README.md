Kopernik
a peer for the Semantic Web-of-Things
---------------------------------------

Concepts & considerations:

1. Device nodes will run an agent and register themselves to another node
2. Some nodes will act purely as a hub for other nodes
3. Some nodes may not natively speak the kopernik protocol.
4. Connectivity between nodes forms a distributed model for inventory and discovery.
